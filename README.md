 Brain Tumor Classification using ResNet50 & t-SNE
 Objective
To develop an interpretable deep learning pipeline for classifying brain MRI scans into tumor / no-tumor categories using transfer learning (ResNet50) and explainability techniques (Grad-CAM, t-SNE).
________________________________________
 Methodology
1.	Data Preparation
o	MRI images resized to 224x224 pixels
o	Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom) to enhance generalization
o	Labels: 1 (Tumor), 0 (No Tumor)
2.	Model Architecture
o	Pretrained ResNet50 used as feature extractor
o	Added layers: Global Average Pooling + Dropout + Dense (sigmoid)
o	Base layers frozen to retain ImageNet weights
3.	Training
o	Optimizer: Adam
o	Loss: binary_crossentropy
o	Early Stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks
4.	Explainability
o	Grad-CAM: Highlights MRI regions important for classification
o	t-SNE: Projects high-dimensional features into 2D for visualization
________________________________________
 Results
•	Validation Accuracy: 84.31%
•	Key Observations:
o	Grad-CAM heatmaps align with tumor regions
o	t-SNE shows partial but meaningful separation between classes

 Steps Overview
 STEP 1: Install Dependencies

Install essential libraries like kaggle for dataset access and opencv-python-headless for image processing.

 STEP 2: Download & Unzip Dataset
Authenticate with Kaggle using kaggle.json and download the brain tumor MRI dataset. It contains two classes: yes (tumor), no (no tumor).
 STEP 3: Load & Preprocess Data
Images are loaded, resized to 224x224, converted to NumPy arrays, and labeled (1 for tumor, 0 for no tumor).
 STEP 4: Train-Validation Split
Split dataset into 80% training and 20% validation using train_test_split.
 STEP 5: Data Generators
Apply data augmentation on training data with ImageDataGenerator. Validation data is only normalized using preprocess_input.
 STEP 6: Build ResNet50 Model
Use pretrained ResNet50 + custom classification head. Add dropout and sigmoid activation for binary output. Freeze initial layers.
 STEP 7: Train Model
Train for 15 epochs with callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau). Final validation accuracy: 84.31%.
 STEP 8: Evaluate Model
Evaluate performance on validation set. High accuracy indicates good generalization for medical images.
 STEP 9: Grad-CAM Visualization
Use Grad-CAM to highlight critical regions in MRIs. Heatmaps overlaid on original images for interpretability.
 Confidence Visualization
Show model prediction confidence (%) alongside images. Helps understand model certainty and borderline cases.
 t-SNE Projection with Decision Boundary
Use t-SNE to reduce ResNet features to 2D. Visualize separation using logistic regression decision boundary.

 Final Discussion
The pipeline balances performance and interpretability — vital for real-world medical diagnostics.
 Limitations
•	Small dataset size
•	Binary classification (tumor / no tumor only)
•	Possible label noise
 Future Work
•	Use larger datasets like BraTS
•	Try 3D CNNs for volumetric MRI
•	Implement ensemble techniques for better robustness

 Usage Instructions
1.	Clone this repository and open the Colab notebook.
2.	Upload your kaggle.json file to download the dataset.
3.	Run the cells sequentially for smooth execution.
4.	Replace image_paths with your own MRI image folder if using a custom dataset.
5.	Modify parameters like epochs, learning rate, or t-SNE perplexity to suit your needs.
 Note: Fix minor typos like sklearn.manifold.TSNE and correct plotting functions (axs vs axes) for improved clarity and reproducibility.
